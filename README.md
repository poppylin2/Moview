# About Moview
Moview is a modern React-based web application that allows users to effortlessly track, organize, and discover movies. With a clean and intuitive user interface, Moview makes it easy for users to search for films, view detailed information, and manage their favorite movies. Additionally, users can stream movie trailers directly within the app, enhancing their discovery experience.

## Key Features
* `Movie Search`
  
Users can search for movies by title, genre, or keywords. Moview leverages external APIs to provide access to a vast and diverse movie database, ensuring that users can find everything from recent blockbusters to classic films.

* `Detailed Movie Information`

Each movie listing includes comprehensive details such as cast, director, synopsis, release date, and user ratings. This rich information helps users make informed decisions on what to watch. Furthermore, users can stream movie trailers directly within the app to preview upcoming or interesting films.

* `Favorites Management`

Moview allows users to create and manage a personalized list of favorite movies. This feature helps users keep track of films they love or plan to watch later, making it easy to revisit their list at any time.
* `Responsive Design`

The app is fully responsive, ensuring that users have a seamless experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Moview adjusts its layout and interface to provide an optimized viewing experience regardless of screen size.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
